### AFFILIATION
Data Networking Lab, University of Aizu
### RESEARCH TOPIC
Practical gadget using Arduino

Main purpose of this research is to reduce the cost to buy useful device. Generally, useful device made by old technology is expensive. Then, we can replace them by the device using Arduino to reduce the cost. We know that the expensive device is suitable if we require higher precision, but when we use that in ordinary life, we don't need higher precision. we want to make the device with medium performance and lower cost.
### HOW TO REACH ME
Visit Lab (121-E, 1st(ground) floor of Research Quadrangles)

~Visit REMs haus (K1, 3rd floor of Student Hall)~ (Due to CORONAVIRUSD, we can't use REMs haus now.)

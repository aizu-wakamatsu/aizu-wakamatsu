# aizu-wakamatsu
Good day! This is my profile.

### ME
I am University of Aizu student for five years. I will experience my third time at "6th-year student" in my life(primary school, unified secondary school and three times of fourth-year student at university). I don't put my true name here because it is unattractive and it doesn't have any values, but you can find me on Facebook if you want to know that.

### WHERE I LIVE
Somewhere at Aizu-wakamatsu. You can see wonderful night view of downtown from the road near my house. There is also a hidden place to see fireworks festival.

### BIRTHDAY
Same as [gpioblink](https://github.com/gpioblink)(We call him "Gib"). Hey you, celebrating his birthday, don't forget that that day is also my birthday! (It doesn't mean "Buy me some gifts", just keep me in mind.) ...Hmm, only Gib gets people's attention, it's unpleasant.

### ACADEMIC RECORD

I have 87 credits (GPA: 2.34) at the end of third quarter this academic year(April to March).

My TOEIC score is 730 (Institutional Program, at 15 February 2020).

In University of Aizu, we have to get 128 credits(120 credits of lecture course and 8 credits of graduation thesis). However, Most of the students have to get more extra credits because of another requirement. We have to get 10 credits of general education courses(sociology, physical activities...), 15 credits of English language courses and 95 credits of specialized courses(mathematics, programming...). Furthermore, each category is subdivided and many of them have the requirements of credits. We have to satisfy all of the requirements. For these, I have to get 138 credits total to graduate(extra 10 credits).

### AFFILIATION
Data Networking Lab, University of Aizu

### RESEARCH TOPIC
Practical gadget using Arduino

Main purpose of this research is to reduce the cost to buy useful device. Generally, useful device made by old technology is expensive. Then, we can replace them by the device using Arduino to reduce the cost. We know that the expensive device is suitable if we require higher precision, but when we use that in ordinary life, we don't need higher precision. we want to make the device with medium performance and lower cost.

### HOW TO REACH ME

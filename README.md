I am University of Aizu student for more than five years. I enjoy the experience of my third time at "6th-year student" in my life(primary school, unified secondary school and three times of fourth-year student at university undergraduate). I don't put my true name here for reasons below, but you can find me on Facebook if you want to know that......It's impossible to hide my true name. Someone write that in somewhere, or please find me at Facebook.

##### why you don't put name?

We think user's true name should not be public if user is not famous person like Mayor or President. (For famous persons, there are other solution to handle this risk explained below.) We think putting our true name here is risky action for protecting our privacy. We know it is important and fundamental function of this page that putting our true name here and to gain your confidence. We can say that only if we are always doing good thing and all of you have good reputation of us. In real life, some of you have bad reputation of us and we sometimes do bad things, even if we are always taking care of our behaviours(actually, it is not and we cannot). For example, this is just an example case, in Japan(and most countries), when we arrested as suspect, the case will be reported in Newspapers and the article with our name. That may be searchable by web search engine like Bing and some of you read the article. This means we have risk of getting bad reputation of our name. Although our true name are not changable in general(in Japan), it may affect on some life events which are and are "not related" to our crime(or some bad thing)s. We cannot say that we don't have that risk. Thus, we don't put our true name here(and any of our self-intros) to avoid that risk.

### WHERE I LIVE
Somewhere at Aizu-wakamatsu.

### ACADEMIC RECORD

Credits: 135 of 143 (End of Q4, 2023)

In University of Aizu, we have to get 128 credits(120 credits of lecture course and 8 credits of graduation thesis). However, Most of the students have to get more extra credits because of another requirement. We have to get 10 credits of general education courses(sociology, physical activities...), 15 credits of English language courses and 95 credits of specialized courses(mathematics, programming...). Furthermore, each category is subdivided and many of them have the requirements of credits. We have to satisfy all of the requirements. For these, I have to get 143 credits total to graduate(extra 15 credits). You can get ant credit for English language course when you get over 750 score for TOEIC exams.

I don't know this system of 26th student or later. Recently many system has changed every year so please ask student affairs division.

### AFFILIATION

Laboratory's name is of before March 2022 because lab's name removed due to the discontinuation of lab system in UoA, at the beginning of AY2022.

### RESEARCH TOPIC
Practical gadget using Arduino
<!--
Main purpose of this research is to reduce the cost to buy useful device. Generally, useful device made by old technology is expensive. Then, we can replace them by the device using Arduino to reduce the cost. We know that the expensive device is suitable if we require higher precision, but when we use that in ordinary life, we don't need higher precision. we want to make the device with medium performance and lower cost.
-->

Engineers can use high-functional device like smartphones or smartwatches because they are familiar with new technology. We thought about for my mum or grandma, they are not familiar with that so it is diffifult to use high-functional device. I do something about hardware design for people who is not familiar with technology.

### HOW TO REACH ME

I am suspended from UoA now, please contact me if you want to reach me.

~I am at {UBIC, Lab, GeekDojo, etc..}~

~Visit Lab (325-E, Second floor(三階) of Research Quadrangles)~

### WHAT I WANT
You know that there are persons like who can make zero to one(create new things), one to ten(expand the business), etc......

Then, I want the person who can make minus to zero(retrieve the honour). If you have the confidence to do that, please contact to me.

### ICTG COURSE (ADVERTISING)
THIS IS INFORMATION OF AY2020. SOME OF THAT MAY CHANGED.

University of Aizu provides the opportunity for Japanese students to take lecture in English.

You can receive completion certificate of ICTG course when you get 128 credits total of...
- English language course. (英語科目。)
- Strongly recommended course **for first-year student** or upper, both Japanese and English are accepted. (1年生以上が対象の基本推奨科目は、日本語クラスでもよい。2年生以上が対象のものは、英語でとる必要がある。)
- Any course held in English **except courses not used for evaluation**. (自由単位を除いて、英語で開講されるすべての科目。)
- Graduation thesis. (卒業論文。)

If you are enroled in ICTG course from your upper-class, it will be difficult to achieve that because you already got these credits in Japanese class. You may fulfill the requirements of graduation before you achieve these.

Don't worry, there are another merits to enrol in ICTG course.

- Some courses are held in different quarter from Japanese class so you can make course taking plan flexibly.

- Some classes are held with small number of students so some of you feel more confortable than Japanese classes.

- Each professor have different thinking about teaching method.

You also can take Japanese class if you want. ICTG course doesn't prohibit you to take lectures in Japanese. Some course need special registration method. You can't register these course using course planning system(not displaying to that system). You have to go to SAD to register these course in course changing period. You also can change registration to English class from Japanese class. In this situation, you have priority to change registration because changing period for ICTG students is earlier than that of normal students. Please remember that it will not be regarded as ICTG credit if you take lecture in Japanese class for some reasons. Unfortunately, even if you take Japanese class due to over capacity of English class, it will not be regarded as ICTG credits.

If you want to change your environment to take lecture, I recommend you to enrol in ICTG course. I don't guarantee the correctness of these information, please ask university staff for details.
<!--
***DUE TO CORONAVIRUS-DISASTER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO TAKE THE COURSE IN ICTG COURSE. CAPACITY OF LECTURE ROOM IS REDUCED AND THEY GIVE PRIORITY TO STUDENTS TAKING THEIR OWN CLASS, REGISTRATION WILL CHANGE TO JAPANESE CLASS OR CANCELLED!***

we will add materials about repeating academic years(留年) later.
